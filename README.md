üß† AI Language Tutor (n8n + Supabase + ElevenLabs)
This project automates a two-part AI Language Tutor using n8n, Supabase, and ElevenLabs. It personalizes language learning by leveraging user preferences, maintaining chat history memory, generating AI-driven responses, and providing text-to-speech audio replies.

üöÄ Workflows Overview
This project consists of two core n8n workflows that work together to create a seamless user experience.

1Ô∏è‚É£ User Onboarding
Purpose: To collect and store the language learning preferences for each new user.

Trigger: A POST request to the webhook endpoint: /user-onboarding.

Action: Saves the user's data to the user_preferences table in a Supabase database.

Output: A JSON response confirming success.

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "User preferences saved successfully."
}

2Ô∏è‚É£ Conversational Tutor
Purpose: To respond to the user chat message.

Trigger: A POST request to the webhook endpoint: /chat-message.

Process:

Fetches the user's stored preferences and the last 10 messages from their chat history.

Constructs a smart, context-aware prompt for the language model.

Generates a personalized response using LLaMA 4 Maverick (via OpenRouter).

Saves both the user's new message and the AI's response to the chat_history table using Supabase Database.

Converts the AI's text response into speech using the ElevenLabs API.

Returns the generated audio file directly in the webhook response.
